[back](../README.md)

The project is being created in Typescript and built using webpack with babel.
Babel uses the env and typescript presets to convert Typescript into Javascript.

Server component
I'm using node and express for the server component.  
This will serve the ui and provide a small api to get back the data and images.  The image location should be configurable.


UI component
The UI should be purely typescript but that may change if a decision is made to use a framework.  It's possible it may be written in vue at a later date.
