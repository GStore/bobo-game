[back](../README.md)

The project is being created in Typescript and built using webpack with babel.  
Babel uses the env and typescript presets to convert Typescript into Javascript.

### Server
Node and Express are used for the server component.  
This will serve the ui and provide a small api to get back the data and images.  The image location should be configurable.


### UI 
The UI uses Vue.js 

### Config 
The server has it's own webpack config.  The UI is configured with vue.config.js.
